"""Workflows owned by Local or a shared space, database mode.

Each workflow is one doc of the host data service under the reserved id
``ducky.automations``: Local = the account's Personal scope (never leaves this PC),
a shared space = that space's scope (its changes are queued for the spaces provider
to sync; the space meta row says whether this account may change them). Docs are
sealed for the account. Unlike ``PluginData`` this module names its scope on every
call: the list shows Local and every space at once, whatever project is open.

Per-PC state never syncs: the run log, last run and "Run on this PC" live in
``workflow_runtime``; saved versions in ``workflow_versions`` (sealed too).

Folders: each workflow carries its own ``folder`` path. The owner's folder list
(empty folders included) is one more doc of the same scope under the reserved key
``_folders``, ``{"folders": ["Play tests", "Play tests/Tycoon"]}``, so a space's
tree syncs with its workflows and the website can read it.
