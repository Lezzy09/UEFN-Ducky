"""Apps & features' Uninstall opens UEFN Ducky's own uninstaller.

Setup installs ``Uninstall UEFN Ducky.exe`` (the Setup host under its uninstall name,
release/installer/host/Uninstall.cs) beside the app and points the uninstall entry at
it. A copy that updates itself (``frontend.update_swap``) never runs Setup again, so on
start the app copies the uninstaller its own version ships into the install folder and
points the entry there. Per-user installs only: an all-users entry and Program Files
need administrator rights, and those copies get it with their next Setup.
Inno's quiet uninstall command is left alone, so scripted uninstalls never see a window.
